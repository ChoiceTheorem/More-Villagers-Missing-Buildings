This is an add-on to [More Villagers: Re-employed](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-villagers-re-employed). While the main mod adds 8* professions, it only adds 5 buildings to minecraft vanilla village. This mod will fix that gap.

⚠️Issues:
Do not report issues from this mod to the original author instead report them to the link provided on this page to the github issue tracker. Any issue with the main mod will be passed onto the dev of the main mod.

📝Future Plans:
- Enderologist houses for enderologist villager
- Built-in support for various mods such as:
  - Repurposed structures
  - ChoiceTheorem's overhauled villages
  - Towns and towers
